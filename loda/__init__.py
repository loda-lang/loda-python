"""Python implementation of the [LODA Language](https://loda-lang.org/):
an assembly language and computational model for finding integer sequence programs.

This Python package allows you to read and write LODA programs, to evaluate
them to integer sequences, to search for matches in the
[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences®](https://www.oeis.org/) (OEIS®),
and to use machine learning from [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
to find new integer sequence programs.
